- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

One reason is that you can gain control over how the component works, and when certain actions are carried out.

      componentDidMount()
      componentDidUpdate()

A custom hook will let you create one hook that handles multiple states that do the same thing/more DRY.
